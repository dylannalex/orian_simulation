class SteadyTrendAlgorithm(TradingAlgorithm):
    """
    A trading algorithm that predicts a steady trend in stock prices based on recent closing prices.

    This algorithm analyzes the closing prices within a specified window size and predicts the overall trend based on the consistency of consecutive price movements. It predicts:
    
    - INCREASE: If all prices within the window increase consecutively.
    - DECREASE: If all prices within the window decrease consecutively.
    - STABLE: If the prices within the window fluctuate without showing a consistent increase or decrease.
    - UNKNOWN: If there are not enough data points to fill the specified window size.

    The algorithm is ideal for identifying consistent price trends over short periods, focusing on detecting continuous, unbroken upward or downward movements in stock prices.

    Args:
        window_size (int): The number of recent closing prices to analyze for trend prediction.

    Attributes:
        window_size (int): Defines the number of closing prices used to evaluate the trend.
        name (str): A name for the algorithm, indicating the window size being used.

    A trading algorithm that predicts the dominant trend in stock prices based on recent closing prices.

    - INCREASE: if the majority of consecutive price movements within the window show an increase.
    - DECREASE: if the majority of consecutive price movements within the window show a decrease.
